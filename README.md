## React Fundamental Concepts Used
This project demonstrates various fundamental React concepts:
1. **Components**: Modular, reusable components for each UI section.
2. **Props**: Passing data between parent and child components.
3. **State**: Managing dynamic data using `useState`.
4. **Hooks**: Using `useEffect` for side effects, `useContext` for global state management
5. **React Router**: Implementing page navigation and category-based views.


## Data Handling and Management
For managing data, this project uses:
- **Context API**: Used to manage global state for the cart and wishlist, allowing seamless data flow between components.
- **Local Storage**: Cart and wishlist data are saved in local storage to maintain user choices across sessions.


## Features
1. **Dynamic Product Categories**: Includes product categories for Laptops, Phones, Accessories, Smartwatches, MacBooks, and iPhones.
2. **Add to Cart & Wishlist**: Allows users to add items to a cart or wishlist, with immediate feedback and updates to the cart count in the navbar.
3. **Persisted State with Local Storage**: Cart and wishlist data are stored in local storage, ensuring items remain in place even after a page refresh.
4. **Responsive Design**: Optimized for different screen sizes for a seamless user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
5. **Filter**: Enables users to filter through products, ensuring easy navigation and a user-friendly shopping experience.
